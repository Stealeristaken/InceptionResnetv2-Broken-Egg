# Inception Resnetv2 Broken Egg


Inception ResNet v2 is a deep neural network architecture that was developed as an extension of the Inception architecture. The Inception architecture was introduced by Google in 2014 and is characterized by the use of multiple filters with different sizes in the same convolutional layer. The Inception architecture has shown to be effective for image classification tasks, but its performance is limited by the depth of the network.

To overcome this limitation, the Inception ResNet v2 architecture incorporates residual connections, which were first introduced in the ResNet architecture. Residual connections allow for easier training of very deep neural networks, by passing the input of a layer directly to a later layer. This helps to mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients, where gradients become too small to update the weights of earlier layers during backpropagation.

The Inception ResNet v2 architecture consists of a stem, multiple Inception modules, and a classification head. The stem is the initial part of the network that performs basic feature extraction from the input image. It is followed by multiple Inception modules, which are composed of multiple branches, each of which performs a different operation on the input feature maps. The output of each branch is concatenated and fed to the next Inception module.

The Inception ResNet v2 architecture has shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, including the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) and the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset. The model has also been adapted for transfer learning, where the pre-trained network is fine-tuned on a smaller dataset for a specific task. The transfer learning approach has shown to be effective for image recognition tasks, such as object detection and image segmentation.

In summary, the Inception ResNet v2 architecture represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision. It provides researchers with a powerful tool for image classification and object detection tasks, and its use of residual connections allows for the training of very deep neural networks.
